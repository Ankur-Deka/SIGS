# Intro
This script will help you run grid search on any python script. 

# File structure
Your code should include the following elements:
1. A main file which accepts arguments with argparse. Let's call is `main.py` but can be anything.
1. The `main.py` should return a data, eg. accuracy, that you would like to compile across runs for different hyperparameter configuration.
2. A function to compile the data returned by `main.py`. This function should be able to take the data points iteratively. An simple function is already provided.
